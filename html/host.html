                  <p>My experience with this program exceeded any expectations. Our mentee was Amy. Amy was so sweet and appreciative. She seemed to really enjoy the city and learning about the tech industry. Upon arrival, Amy seemed uncertain about her goals and future plans. Before she left, she seemed much more confident and excited about her future career in technology. </p>

                  <p>I believe our family benefited from the Inchange program just as much as our mentee, Jessica. Jessica and our daughter, Addison, became instant friends and plan to stay in touch. Our mentee was initially shy and timid, but she really seemed to benefit from the experience. She had never been to a “real” city before and she seemed very interested in starting her own tech company. I have no doubt that she will succeed! </p>

                  <p>I plan do this every year now! The tech company I work for is owned and operated by mostly women. I brought our mentee, Katie, to work with me on several occasions and she seemed to really benefit from meeting and networking with my colleagues. She even contributed in some brainstorming sessions. It was really great to see her learn and grow. She is welcome back anytime.</p>
